# transit-screen

A RasPi project to display next transit arrival times along with some other stuff. Originally intended to just display arrival time, but decided to succumb to feature creep. :)

## Goals

Using an e-ink screen, display next transit arrival times at configured stops, along with other set widgets, including weather/AQI, calendar, news, etc. The screen should update estimated transit arrival time once a minute or so, and fully refresh once or twice a day to maintain longevity.
